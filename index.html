					<p class="element">Air</p>
					<img class="airbender" src="img/air.png">
					<p class="air-desctiption"> Air is the element of freedom. The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly problems and concerns; finding peace and freedom was the key to solving their difficulties in life. Airbenders continually sought spiritual enlightenment, and, as a result, all children born into the Air Nomads were benders. The first airbenders learned their art from the flying bison.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-3">
					<p class="element">Water</p>
					<img class="waterbender" src="img/water.png">
					<p class="water-desctiption"> Water is the element of change. The moon is the source of power in waterbending, and the original waterbenders learned to bend by observing how the moon pushed and pulled the tides. The Water Tribes are the only people who did not learn bending from an animal, though the Moon and Ocean Spirits took the form of koi fish in the mortal world near the beginning of the Avatar World.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-3">
					<p class="element">Earth</p>
					<img class="earthbender" src="img/earth.png">
					<p class="earth-desctiption"> Earth is the element of substance, while the people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse, strong, and enduring. Following the lion turtles' decision to relinquish their role as protectors of mankind, Oma and Shu were the first earthbenders to learn this art from the badgermoles.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-3">
					<p class="element">Fire</p>
					<img class="firebender" src="img/fire.png">
					<p class="fire-desctiption">Fire is the element of power, consisting of overpowering force tempered by the unflinching will to accomplish tasks and desires. However, during the Hundred Year War, a militaristic Fire Nation twisted this into firebending being fueled by rage, hatred, and anger. Firebending draws its power from the sun, and the first human firebenders derived their firebending techniques from the dragons.</p>

Human civilization is divided into four nations; the Water Tribes, the Earth Kingdom, the Fire Nation, and the Air Nomads. Avatar is notable for borrowing extensively from Asian art and mythology to create its fictional universe. The show's character designs are influenced by both American cartoons and anime. Traditional East Asian calligraphy styles are used for nearly all the writing in the show. </p>
